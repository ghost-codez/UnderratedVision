## 🛠️ Installation

### Pre-Requisites

**Note**: If you're using Windows, we highly recommend using [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

1. **Docker Setup**:
   - **Windows/Mac**: Use [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
   - **Linux**: Use [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
   - **WSL2**: Install Docker directly inside WSL ([guide](https://gist.github.com/dehsilvadeveloper/c3bdf0f4cdcc5c177e2fe9be671820c7))

2. **Python Requirements**: You need at least [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.

3. **API Keys**: During installation, you'll need to set up your `OPENAI_API_KEY`. For other models, review the [Model Client Configuration](#model-client-configuration) section.

### Standard Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/ghost-codez/UnderratedVision.git
cd UnderratedVision
git submodule update --init --recursive

# 2. Install Magentic-UI
cd magentic-ui
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install magentic-ui --upgrade

# 3. Configure environment
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# 4. Launch platform
magentic-ui --port 8081
```

### Advanced Installation Options

**Using uv (faster dependency management)**:
```bash
cd magentic-ui
uv sync --dev
uv run magentic-ui --port 8081
```

**Without Docker** (limited functionality):
```bash
magentic-ui --run-without-docker --port 8081
```

**Custom LLM Clients**:
```bash
# Azure OpenAI
pip install magentic-ui[azure]

# Ollama (local models)
pip install magentic-ui[ollama]
```

### Model Client Configuration

You can configure different LLM providers by passing a config file to `magentic-ui` or changing the model client in the UI settings. See the [Magentic-UI documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/magentic-ui) for detailed configuration options.

## � Security

### API Key Management

**IMPORTANT**: Never commit your `.env` file or API keys to version control.

1. **Setup your environment**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your OPENAI_API_KEY
   ```

2. **Verify .env is ignored**:
   ```bash
   git status
   # Should NOT show .env file
   ```

3. **Use the startup script**:
   ```bash
   ./start_underratedvision.sh
   ```

### Security Best Practices

- ✅ Never commit `.env` files
- ✅ Never share API keys in chat/email
- ✅ Rotate keys regularly
- ✅ Use environment variables for secrets
- ✅ Enable GitHub secret scanning
- ✅ Review `.gitignore` before committing

For detailed security guidelines, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
